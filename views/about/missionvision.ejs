<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p class="mt15">Vision Vidya, the center of excellence aims at creating a scientific temper among students. They move from rote learning to a mode in which they are encouraged to ask questions like the how and why of concepts. We create thinkers and research scholars as leaders of tomorrow who can analyze and synthesize information as per the need of the hour. We do not believe in just acquiring general knowledge. We facilitate students in developing the powers of reasoning and judgment, and preparing them intellectually for a mature life.</p>
